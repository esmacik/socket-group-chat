# Socket Group Chat

An implementation of a group chat using Java sockets.

Many client machines can connect and send messages to the server socket machine via the server socket machine's IP address and port. The server machine delegates a thread to listen to each client. Each of these threads displays each incoming message as well as the name of the user that sent the message.

This was provided as a demo for students in Advanced Object Oriented Programming at The University of Texas at El Paso in Spring 2022. Students used provided presentation slides in order to complete the `MessageClientForStudents.java` skeleton code as an exercise.
